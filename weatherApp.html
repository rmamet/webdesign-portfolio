            This Weather App was made to be a "fun and original" app. By hitting
            <a href="https://weather.gov/">https://weather.gov</a>'s API, I am
            able to get the weather for any location in the United States of
            America. To determine "Should you wear a shirt", it checks (in
            order) the Probability of Precipitation, the Temperature, the
            Relative Humidity, and if it is Daytime. This was a really good
            refresher on APIs other than the one that I made.
